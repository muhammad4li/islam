                        Salam, I am Muhammad and welcome to this website. I have made
                        this website to help people become better Muslims. Even 
                        if you aren't Muslim you can use this website to learn
                        about Islam.

                        Quran, Sunnah and much much more. I will also be going over some things
                        regarding other religions, beliefs, morals, ethics and history. For each
